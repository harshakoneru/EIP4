Definitions:

*1. Convolution*
```
A convolution is a mathematical operation between two signals (image and kernel) which 
generates a third signal - which is like a representation of how the shape of one signal
impacts the other. 
```

*2. Filters/Kernels*
```
A filter/kernel is a template which is used in convolutions to extract a specific 
feature from the input signal
```

*3. Epochs*
```
An epoch is defined as the process of running through the entire set of training examples
once while traning a neural network
```
*4. 1x1 Convolution*
```
A 1x1 Convolution is used in order to preserve the resolution of an image while changing 
the number of channels it is represented with
```

*5. 3x3 Convolution*
```
A 3x3 convolution acts like a feature extractor which reduces the input size and captures
it's essential features when used with the right kernel
```

*6. Feature Maps*
```
In a convolutional neural network, a feature map is the representation of how the kernel
maps the input image onto the next layer
```

*7. Activation Function*
```
The activation function defines the way in which the neurons in a neural network get
activated and propogate the signal to the next layer
```

*8. Receptive Field*
```
The receptive field of a neuron in a network defines the extent of the original image which the
neuron 'sees'
```
